<h1>Welcome!</h1>

	Thanks for visiting Josh Rachner's portfolio.  Included is information on the technologies I use, descriptions of previous job experience, a blog, and contact information.

	Currently, I am working at a company called Sense Corp, where we do business technology consulting. I couldn't be at a better place... I graduated from the Red McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin.  I studied Management Information Systems, Computer Science, and Business.  In just 4 short years, I received a major/minor (MIS/CS), and had the opportunity to work at 4 different companies, all of which were computing jobs. I have now been out of school for quite some time, and have worked with almost a dozen companies. <br/><span style="font-size: 11px;"><a href="/experience">Read More >></a></span>

	I truly believe that success takes a lifetime.  My desire is to start a nationwide young-student workshop to teach kids between the ages of 13-21 about starting careers.  It will be designed to give kids the opportunity to do real world projects with other peers, while being supervised by experts in the fields of engineering, programming, mathematics, business, and science.
